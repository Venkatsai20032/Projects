# 📄 Retail Sales Forecasting and Visualization Project Summary

## 1. Project Title
**Retail Sales Forecasting and Visualization using Machine Learning and Power BI**

---

## 2. Objective
To accurately predict future retail sales using Machine Learning techniques and present insights through interactive dashboards built in Power BI for better business decision-making.

---

## 3. Tools and Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, XGBoost
- **Business Intelligence:** Power BI
- **Other Libraries:** Statsmodels, Time Series Analysis modules

---

## 4. Dataset
- **Source:** Retail Sales Forecasting Dataset (CSV file)
- **Features:**  
  - `date` (Date of sale)  
  - `store` (Store ID)  
  - `item` (Item ID)  
  - `sales` (Number of sales)  

---

## 5. Major Steps Followed

### 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
- Converted `date` column to datetime format, handled parsing errors (`dayfirst=True`).
- Set `date` as the dataset index for time series modeling.
- Handled missing values and cleaned inconsistent data entries.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed overall sales trends across time.
- Explored store-wise and item-wise performance.
- Visualized correlation heatmaps for feature relations.

### ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Created lag features to capture past sales performance.
- Built time-based features (month, week, day) to capture seasonality.

### 🤖 Model Building
- Applied Linear Regression and XGBoost Regressor for forecasting.
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² scores.

### 📈 Power BI Deployment
- Exported final dataset with predictions into a CSV file.
- Created dynamic, interactive dashboards:
  - Sales Trends over Time
  - Store-wise Sales Comparison
  - Forecast vs Actual Performance
- Enhanced with custom colors, slicers, and filters for dynamic user interaction.

## 6. Key Outcomes
- Achieved accurate short-term forecasting of retail sales.
- Built an end-to-end professional-grade data science project with BI integration.
- Created an easily understandable dashboard for stakeholders' decision support.
